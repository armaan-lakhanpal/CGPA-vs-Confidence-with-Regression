Academic achievement among students is shaped by a variety of behavioral and personal factors,
with classroom participation often highlighted as a key contributor to both learning and
self-development. In the context of our institute, there is a noticeable spectrum of student
engagement, some participate actively while others remain passive. Drawing inspiration from this
observation, the present study centers on a locally relevant question: “Does regular class
participation enhance student confidence and improve academic performance as measured by
CGPA?”
Prior academic works affirm the link between engagement and achievement; participation fosters
not only deeper understanding but builds community and self-efficacy. Notably, systems like
WICAT have shown measurable improvements in exam outcomes by systematically encouraging
students to participate. This project goes beyond cataloging attendance or self-reported confidence
by employing quantitative analysis to determine the strength and reliability of these relationships
among first-semester students.
